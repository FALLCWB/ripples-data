# Claim manifest

Every quantity reported in the manuscript is listed here with the level at which a
reader can reconstruct it from this package, and with the file that actually produces
it. The levels are:

- **R1 recomputed** — recomputed from released per-repetition observations by running
  the named script. The number is produced, not read back.
- **R2 regenerated** — regenerated from a released summary or label file. The pipeline
  is in the package, but its input corpus is not, so running the named script
  reproduces the figure or table cell rather than recomputing the statistic.
- **R3 measured summary** — recorded at collection time and released as a summary. It
  cannot be recomputed here because the underlying raw observations (process-memory
  dumps, per-run schedules) are not redistributed.
- **R4 not reconstructible** — depends on the raw capture corpus or on the SDN testbed
  harness, neither of which is part of this package.

Raw process-memory captures hold live process memory and are too large to host online.
The SDN testbed harness that drives the Open vSwitch collection is not part of this
package. `data/snapshots/` is empty in the release: any script taking `--snapshots`
requires that corpus and therefore cannot reach R1 here, whatever it can do on the
collection host.

Two Spearman coefficients on surface ship in the package and are different quantities:
`stats_summary.json` carries the per-hour label rate against surface (rho = -0.13), which is
what Fig. 2(a) reports, and `surface_excess_spearman.json` carries post-action excess against
surface (rho = 0.09) and a count reading over a 300 s window (rho = -0.12).

`threshold_comparison.csv` also carries two treatments that recover no induced
repetition (`T4_z3` and `T5_z5`, 0/30). The manuscript compares the four descriptive
treatments and does not report those two.

What the grid in §VI evaluates per cell is label stability and induced-cascade
retention. It does not evaluate a per-cell induced false-association rate; the
false-association reading is the shifted-anchor control, which is a single descriptive
matched-window contrast rather than a per-cell quantity.
